### Performance
- Streamed audio preprocessing to avoid loading entire files into memory.
- Streamed OpenAI and Google transcription request bodies from temp files.
- Used memory-mapped audio reads where safe to reduce heap pressure.

### Memory
- Read PCM16 samples in chunks for local and on-device transcription engines.
- Truncated browser and OCR context at source to cap payload size.
- Capped stored AI request context strings to prevent runaway memory growth.

### Storage
- Reused audio files via hard links when possible to reduce duplicate storage.
- Cached recent TTS history audio on disk with size limits and cleanup.

### Reliability
- Prevented duplicate playback timers in the audio player view.
