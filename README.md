VoiceInk Community is a maintained fork of the original VoiceInk project. It keeps the same fast, privacy-first transcription experience but removes the paywall, bundles offline models, and relaxes the contribution process so anyone can help shape the app.

Highlights of this fork:

- üí∏ **Fully unlocked** ‚Äì no trials, license prompts, or gated features.
- üì¶ **Models included** ‚Äì Whisper (multiple sizes) and Parakeet ship in the app, ready to use offline.
- üîß **Hackable by default** ‚Äì a friendlier contributing policy and cleaner onboarding for builders.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Offline transcription** ‚Äì Whisper, Parakeet, and Apple Speech models are bundled and ready on first launch.
- üîí **Privacy first** ‚Äì audio and transcripts stay local unless you explicitly export them.
- ‚ö° **Power Mode** ‚Äì detect the active app/URL and auto-apply prompts, models, and paste rules.
- üéØ **Global shortcuts** ‚Äì flexible hotkeys, push-to-talk, and middle-click control.
- üìù **Custom vocabulary** ‚Äì dictionaries, word replacements, and CSV import/export.
- üí¨ **Optional enhancements** ‚Äì local formatting works out of the box; Ollama hooks stay available for power users.
