VoiceLink Community is a maintained fork of the original VoiceInk project. It keeps the same fast, privacy-first transcription experience but removes the paywall, bundles offline models, and relaxes the contribution process so anyone can help shape the app.

Highlights of this fork:

- 💸 **Fully unlocked** – no trials, license prompts, or gated features.
- 📦 **Models included** – Whisper (multiple sizes) and Parakeet ship in the app, ready to use offline.
- 🔧 **Hackable by default** – a friendlier contributing policy and cleaner onboarding for builders.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Offline transcription** – Whisper, Parakeet, and Apple Speech models are bundled and ready on first launch.
- 🔊 **Text-to-speech studio** – Create narration with OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud, or local system voices, complete with previews, batch queueing, translation, and article import tools.
- 🔒 **Privacy first** – audio and transcripts stay local unless you explicitly export them.
- ⚡ **Power Mode** – detect the active app/URL and auto-apply prompts, models, and paste rules.
- 🎯 **Global shortcuts** – flexible hotkeys, push-to-talk, and middle-click control.
- 📝 **Custom vocabulary** – dictionaries, word replacements, and CSV import/export.
- 💬 **Optional enhancements** – local formatting works out of the box; Ollama hooks stay available for power users.

## Get Started

### Download or Build

- **Releases** – check the repository releases tab for notarized builds of the community edition.
- **Homebrew (optional)** – once a tap is available you’ll be able to `brew install --cask voiceink-community`.
- **From source** – follow [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) to compile the app with Xcode. Run `./scripts/download-models.sh` beforehand to drop the default Whisper binaries into the bundle if you haven’t downloaded them yet.
