## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

The tests are ready to run but require:
1. **Valid code signing certificate** or disable signing for testing
2. **Xcode 16.0+** (already installed)
3. **macOS 14.0+** (Sonoma) - you have this

### Option 1: Run in Xcode (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run tests with proper signing:

1. Open the project:
   ```bash
   open "/Users/deborahmangan/Desktop/Prototypes/dev/untitled folder 3/VoiceInk.xcodeproj"
   ```

2. In Xcode:
   - Select the **VoiceInk** scheme
   - Press **⌘U** to run all tests
   - Or click Product → Test

3. View results:
   - Press **⌘6** to open Test Navigator
   - See all 249 tests organized by file
   - Green checkmarks = passing tests
   - Red X = failing tests (investigate these!)

### Option 2: Command Line with Signing

If you have valid signing configured:

```bash
cd "/Users/deborahmangan/Desktop/Prototypes/dev/untitled folder 3"

# Run all tests
xcodebuild test \
  -project VoiceInk.xcodeproj \
  -scheme VoiceInk \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,name=My Mac'
```

### Option 3: Disable Signing for Tests

If you don't have signing certificates, temporarily disable signing:

1. Open Xcode
2. Select VoiceInk project
3. Go to Signing & Capabilities tab
4. Uncheck "Automatically manage signing"
5. Select "None" for Team
6. Run tests with ⌘U

## 🔍 Running Tests with Sanitizers (Critical!)

After basic tests pass, run with sanitizers to detect crashes:

### Thread Sanitizer (Detect Race Conditions)

In Xcode:
1. Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
2. Select "Test" on left
3. Go to "Diagnostics" tab
4. Check ✅ **Thread Sanitizer**
5. Run tests (⌘U)

Or command line:
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project VoiceInk.xcodeproj \
  -scheme VoiceInk \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,name=My Mac' \
  -enableThreadSanitizer YES \
  2>&1 | tee thread_sanitizer_results.txt
```

### Address Sanitizer (Detect Memory Issues)

In Xcode:
1. Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
2. Select "Test" on left
3. Go to "Diagnostics" tab
4. Check ✅ **Address Sanitizer**
5. Run tests (⌘U)

Or command line:
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project VoiceInk.xcodeproj \
  -scheme VoiceInk \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,name=My Mac' \
  -enableAddressSanitizer YES \
  2>&1 | tee address_sanitizer_results.txt
```

### Undefined Behavior Sanitizer

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project VoiceInk.xcodeproj \
  -scheme VoiceInk \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,name=My Mac' \
  -enableUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer YES \
  2>&1 | tee undefined_behavior_results.txt
```

## 📊 What to Look For

### During Normal Test Run

**Good Signs:**
- ✅ Tests complete without crashes
- ✅ Green checkmarks in Test Navigator
- ✅ "Test Succeeded" message
- ✅ No memory warnings

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Tests crash the app
- ❌ Red X failures
- ❌ Timeout errors
- ❌ "Test session crashed" messages

### With Thread Sanitizer

**Look for:**
```
WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race
  Write of size X at 0x...
  Previous read at 0x...
```

This indicates **race conditions** that could cause crashes.

### With Address Sanitizer

**Look for:**
```
AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free
AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow
AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address
```

This indicates **memory corruption** that will crash.

---

## 🐛 Expected Test Results

### Tests That Should Pass

**Unit Tests (187):** Should mostly pass
- Audio system tests may need microphone permission
- Some tests may be skipped if models unavailable

**Integration Tests (17):** Should pass
- Tests cancel early if requirements not met (models, etc.)

**Stress Tests (28):** Should pass
- These are memory/concurrency tests - very important!

**UI Tests (17):** May have some issues
- Require accessibility permissions
- May need app to be already onboarded

### Tests That May Fail/Skip

Some tests may skip with messages like:
```
XCTSkip: No transcription models available
XCTSkip: VAD model not available in test bundle
```

This is **expected and OK** - these tests gracefully skip when resources aren't available.

---

## 📝 Documenting Results

### Create CRASH_FIXES.md

After running tests, document any crashes found:

```markdown
# VoiceInk Crash Fixes

## Thread Sanitizer Results

### Data Race in AudioLevelMonitor.deinit
**Status:** Found ✅
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Race condition in nonisolated deinit
**Fix:** [Describe fix]
**Test:** AudioLevelMonitorTests.testDeinitRaceCondition

### Data Race in AudioDeviceManager.isReconfiguring
**Status:** Found ✅
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Flag not synchronized
**Fix:** [Describe fix]
**Test:** AudioDeviceManagerTests.testDeviceSwitchDuringRecording

## Address Sanitizer Results

[Document any memory issues found]

## Test Failures

[Document any failed tests and reasons]
```

## 🎯 Critical Tests to Watch

These tests target the most likely crash vectors:

### 1. AudioLevelMonitor Tests (21 tests)
- `testNonisolatedDeinitWithTaskExecution` ⭐ **THE CRITICAL BUG**
- `testDeinitRaceCondition` ⭐ **20 rapid cycles**
- All these test the nonisolated deinit race condition

### 2. Concurrency Stress Tests (12 tests)
- `testRecorderMassiveConcurrentStops` - 1000 concurrent stops
- `testAudioDeviceManagerMassiveGetCurrentDevice` - 1000 concurrent calls
- These will expose any race conditions

### 3. Memory Stress Tests (16 tests)
- `testRecorderHundredSessions` - 100 recording sessions
- `testAudioLevelMonitorExtremeCycles` - 100 start/stop cycles
- These will expose memory leaks

### 4. WhisperState Tests (26 tests)
- `testConcurrentCancellationFlagAccess` - 100 concurrent accesses
- Tests the shouldCancelRecording race condition

### 5. TTSViewModel Tests (39 tests)
- `testDeinitCancelsAllTasks` - 5 tasks must cancel properly
- `testRapidAllocDealloc` - 10 rapid cycles
- Tests complex async state management

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Minimum Success
- ✅ 80%+ tests pass
- ✅ No crashes in core tests
- ✅ Memory leaks: 0-5 detected
- ✅ Race conditions: Document all found

### Excellent Success
- ✅ 95%+ tests pass
- ✅ Zero crashes
- ✅ Zero memory leaks
- ✅ Zero race conditions
- ✅ All sanitizers clean

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No schemes available"
- Open project in Xcode first
- Make sure VoiceInk scheme is selected

### "Test session crashed"
- This is what we're looking for! Document it!
- Check which test caused the crash
- Run that test individually to reproduce

### "Permission denied"
Tests may need permissions:
- Microphone access
- Accessibility access  
- Screen recording

Grant these in System Settings → Privacy & Security

### "Model not found"
Some tests need Whisper models:
- Tests will skip gracefully
- This is expected and OK

---

## 📊 Test Execution Time

**Expected times:**
- Unit tests: ~1-2 minutes
- Integration tests: ~30-60 seconds
- Stress tests: ~2-3 minutes
- UI tests: ~30-60 seconds
- **Total:** ~5-7 minutes

**With sanitizers:**
- Each sanitizer run: ~10-15 minutes
- **Total all sanitizers:** ~30-45 minutes

---

## 🎯 Priority Actions

### 1. Run Basic Tests First (Priority: High)
```bash
# In Xcode
⌘U
```

### 2. Run Thread Sanitizer (Priority: Critical)
This will find the AudioLevelMonitor deinit race and other threading issues.

### 3. Run Address Sanitizer (Priority: Critical)  
This will find memory corruption issues.

### 4. Document All Findings (Priority: High)
Create `CRASH_FIXES.md` with all issues found.

### 5. Fix Critical Issues (Priority: Critical)
Focus on:
- AudioLevelMonitor nonisolated deinit
- Any race conditions found
- Any memory corruption found

## 💡 Tips

1. **Run in Xcode first** - Much easier to see results
2. **Check Test Navigator** - See which tests pass/fail
3. **Run failed tests individually** - Easier to debug
4. **Use sanitizers** - They catch hidden bugs
5. **Document everything** - Create CRASH_FIXES.md
6. **Fix one issue at a time** - Don't try to fix everything at once

---

## 🏆 What Success Looks Like

After running all tests and sanitizers:

```
✅ 249 tests executed
✅ 237+ tests passed (95%+)
✅ 12 tests skipped (no models available - expected)
✅ 0 crashes
✅ Thread Sanitizer: Clean or documented races
✅ Address Sanitizer: Clean or documented issues
✅ All issues documented in CRASH_FIXES.md
✅ Regression tests added for any fixes
```

**Result:** VoiceInk is production-ready with systematic crash prevention! 🎉
