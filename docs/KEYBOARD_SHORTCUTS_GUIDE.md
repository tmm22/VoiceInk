# Keyboard Shortcuts and Recording Controls (VoiceLink Community 65.2)

VoiceLink Community supports global hotkeys, push-to-talk, and quick actions for pasting and retrying transcriptions.

## Configure Shortcuts

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Go to `Shortcuts`.
3. Customize the hotkeys and additional actions.

## Recording Hotkeys

- **Hotkey 1 / Hotkey 2**: choose a global trigger for the recorder.
- **Quick tap** starts hands-free recording; tap again to stop.
- **Press and hold** to push-to-talk; release to stop recording.

If you need a second hotkey, click **Add another hotkey** after setting Hotkey 1.

## Recorder Actions

- **Dismiss Recorder**: double-tap `Escape` by default. Enable **Custom Cancel Shortcut** to set a custom key.
- **Middle-Click Toggle**: enable to record with the middle mouse button. Adjust **Activation Delay** in milliseconds.

## Transcription Actions

Set these in `Settings` > `Shortcuts`:

- **Paste Last Transcript (Original)**: paste the most recent raw transcription.
- **Paste Last Transcript (Enhanced)**: paste the enhanced version if available, otherwise the original.
- **Retry Last Transcription**: re-run the last audio through the current model.

## Enhancement Shortcuts

These are available when the recorder is visible:

- **Toggle AI Enhancement**: `Command + E`.
- **Switch Enhancement Prompt**: `Command + 1` through `Command + 0` in prompt order.

## Power Mode Switching

- **Switch Power Mode**: `Option + 1` through `Option + 0` based on the Power Mode list order.

## Shortcut Cheat Sheet

Use the Keyboard Shortcuts view (shown from the app menu or helper UI) to see your current assignments at a glance.

## Troubleshooting

- **Shortcut not firing**: ensure macOS Accessibility permissions are granted.
- **Conflicting hotkeys**: choose a different key combo or remove unused hotkeys.
- **Paste shortcuts do nothing**: record at least one transcription first.
