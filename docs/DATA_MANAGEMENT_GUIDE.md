# Data Management and History Guide (VoiceLink Community 65.2)

VoiceLink Community stores transcripts locally and provides tools to search, export, and clean up data.

## Transcription History

Open `History` from the sidebar to:

- Search by text in original or enhanced transcriptions.
- Expand cards to view details.
- Select multiple items for bulk actions.

### Bulk Actions

When items are selected, a toolbar appears:

- **Analyze**: performance insights for selected items.
- **Export**: CSV, JSON, or Plain Text.
- **Delete**: move selected items to Trash.
- **Select All / Deselect All**: manage large datasets quickly.

## Export Formats

From the History toolbar:

- **CSV**: includes original/enhanced text, models, prompt, Power Mode, timing.
- **JSON**: structured export with metadata.
- **Plain Text**: human-readable archive.

## Trash and Recovery

Deleted items go to Trash for 30 days.

1. Open `Settings` > `Data`.
2. Click **Open Trash**.
3. Restore or permanently delete items.

Use **Empty Trash** to permanently remove all deleted items.

## Data and Privacy Controls

In `Settings` > `Data` > **Data & Privacy**:

- **Automatically delete transcript history**: choose a retention window.
- **Enable automatic audio cleanup**: remove old audio files while keeping text.
- **Run Cleanup Now**: manually purge based on your current settings.

## Import and Export Settings

In `Settings` > `Data` > **Data Management**:

- **Export Settings**: backs up prompts, Power Modes, word replacements, shortcuts, and app preferences (API keys excluded).
- **Import Settings**: restores from a backup file.

Tip: Restart the app after importing settings for the cleanest refresh.
