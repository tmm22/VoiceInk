# Contributing to VoiceInk Community

First off, thank you for your interest in shaping this fork! VoiceInk Community aims to remove friction—no license checks, no nag screens, and local models that just work. The same philosophy applies to contributions: if you have an improvement, we want to see it.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and branch** – work off `main` using feature branches (`git switch -c feat/your-idea`).
2. **Keep it focused** – smaller, well-scoped pull requests are easier to review and merge.
3. **Use plain Swift style** – follow the default Swift formatting conventions; run `swiftformat` or Xcode's reformatting if you have it.
4. **Test what you touch** – build the app, run the relevant flows, and add tests or notes when it helps.

No approval is required before hacking on features or bug fixes. If you’re not sure whether an idea fits, open an issue or draft PR and we’ll figure it out together.

## What We’re Excited About

- **User experience polish** for the community edition (onboarding tweaks, smarter defaults, accessibility).
- **Offline-first enhancements** like new local models, better diarization, or power-mode automation.
- **Developer ergonomics** such as scripting hooks, CLI tools, or documentation updates.

## Submitting Changes

1. Make sure the app builds (`Cmd+B` in Xcode) and your change works end-to-end.
2. Run the targeted tests you touched. If you can’t run a suite, explain why in the PR notes.
3. Open a pull request describing the motivation, approach, and anything reviewers should pay attention to.
4. Expect actionable feedback. We bias toward shipping improvements quickly, even if follow-ups are needed.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind, inclusive, and collaborative. We follow the short-and-sweet community rules in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`—they apply to GitHub discussions, reviews, and the Discord server.

## Need Help?

- Start a discussion or file an issue describing your question.
- Hop into Discord (`Community` tab inside the app) for real-time chats.
- Tag maintainers in a PR if you are blocked—we’d rather unblock you than watch code go stale.

Thanks again for helping make an open, frictionless VoiceInk for everyone!
